# plantuml versus mermaid

Unfortunately github doesn't render plantuml inside markdown files, but apparently there's a 
[kramdown plantuml](https://github.com/SwedbankPay/kramdown-plantuml)
which lets you adds a plugin to `_config.yml`:
```yaml
plugins:
  - "kramdown-plantuml"
```

Which should work at least within a github page.

Let's give it a try.

# sample diagrams

```plantuml
@startuml Diagram
actor client
node app
database db
db -> app
app -> client
@enduml
```

hmm,... not working for me, and I can't seem to find an example.
