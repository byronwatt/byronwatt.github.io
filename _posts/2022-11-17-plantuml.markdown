# plantuml versus mermaid

Unfortunately github doesn't render plantuml inside markdown files, but apparently there's a 
[kramdown plantuml](https://github.com/SwedbankPay/kramdown-plantuml)
plugins:
  - "kramdown-plantuml"

Which should work at least withing a github page.

Let's give it a try.

# sample diagrams

```plantuml
@startuml Diagram
actor client
node app
database db
db -> app
app -> client
@enduml
```
