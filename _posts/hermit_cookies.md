# Anna’s Hermit Cookies

![](/assets/images/annas_recipe.jpg)

## Ingredients (in theory)

<pre>
    2 cups of flour
    1 tsp baking soda
    1 tsp baking powder
    ½ tsp salt
    1½ tsp cinnamon
    ½ tsp nutmeg
    3 tsp ginger
    ½ tsp cloves
    ⅛ tsp allspice
    ½ cup butter at room temperature
    ½ cup brown sugar
    ½ cup fancy molasses
    1 large egg
    2 tablespoons of golden rum
    2 cups total of nuts/fruit e.g.:
        ⅔ cup chopped walnuts
        1 cup of raisins/dates/sour cherries 
        ¼ cup chopped dried apricots 
</pre>

## Reality
More nutmeg, cloves, allspice, last time I used ⅓ c of molasses, but I’ll try ½ c this time (more sugar might make them moister).

2 tablespoons of appleton rum,... sometimes a weeee bit more.

Haven’t measured the fruit and nuts - I’m probably putting in more than I’m supposed to.

Been using unsalted butter - grass fed butter Anna’s hair dresser Tracy said it’s sooooo much better - and I was on keto at the time filling my face with butter.

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 375

Lightly grease cookie sheets with butter

Combine dry stuff in bowl and whisk

Cream the butter in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed.

Beat in the sugar, add the egg and beat until fluffy (i haven’t seen it turn fluffy,... but maybe a bit whiter), add rum & molasses.   Note: scrap the sides periodically otherwise there will be clumps of pure butter in the final batter.

Recipe says with wooden spoon stir in walnuts, sour cherries, dates, raisins & apricots, but with kitchen aid mixer, i just do a few half rotations on slow speed.

Add flour mixture and stir until incorporated. (what’s incorporated mean?),... i again use a few half rotations of the kitchen aid, and when spooning out the dough try to work in the stubborn bits of flour.

Drop the dough by the tablespoonful onto the prepared cookie sheets.

Bake for about 12 minutes, until the cookies are lightly browned and cracked.

Let the cookies cool for 1 minute on the sheets, then transfer them to wire racks to cool completely. (15-20 minutes).

Recipe says it makes 5 dozen, but it only makes 2 dozen of the size we make.
