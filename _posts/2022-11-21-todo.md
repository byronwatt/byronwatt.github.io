# future posts

## state machines

moore state machines in C and generating plantuml from source code.

log state transitions,

## firmware logging to circular buffers by task

## MPU calculator & display

cortex-M7 MPU calculator and display.

two stage linking and programming .text segment to be read-only/execute,
and everything else read/write/no-execute.
and seg-faulting on a stack red-zone.

## logging -> sequence diagram with brewer palette.

## pc/ra logging -> valgrind

## load exclusive/store conditional mutex for cortex.

## bang-bang edge hunting

## calibration in the presence of noise and quantization.

## rational approximations

in digital clock synthesis units we often need to convert one frequency to another with a rational numerator/denominator divider.

The classic continued fractions calculation suffers from very bad successive rounding errors that can produce ludicrously bad results.

different approaches or using the farey algorithm is a better approach.
